Zoom-in to inspect images in beautiful detail using Magic Touch™.

== Description ==

Zoom fast and deep into big photos to see every detail using Magic Touch™.

= Loves big images =

Magic Touch™ works best for images from 1500px to 4000px width or even more. The bigger the better!

Perfect for digital photos and showing stunning detail in your WordPress images.

[Try these 6 examples](http://www.magictoolbox.com/magictouch/examples/).

= How it works... =
	
No matter how big your photo is, users can quickly zoom in and out and pan around, inspecting the image. Magic Touch™ automatically slices big images into hundreds of small images and only serves the images that the user needs.

The very first visitor to your page will automatically trigger the one-time Magic Touch™ operation to fetch and prepare your image for zooming. After that, images load within a couple of seconds for all visitors.

All the files and images are served by Magic Touch™ - not from your site - so you'll need one of these Plans:

= Plans =

**Free Plan**

* 10,000 free zooms every month.
* Magic Touch™ logo in top right corner. 

**Paid plan**

* No Magic Touch™ logo in corner.
* Serve zooms over SSL (secure connections).
* Protect your images with a watermark.
* Add your own logo.
* Starts from Ј19 for 20,000 zooms (no expiry date, no minimum term).
